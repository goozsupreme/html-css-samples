        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Wario Land II is a game by Nintendo that was released in Western regions for the Game Boy in March 1998. This is the second installment of the 
            Wario Land series (third counting Virtual Boy Wario Land). It is a 2D platformer starring Wario, the greedy treasure hunter, who was also the 
            protagonist of the series' first game Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3.<br>
            While the game was originally released as a Super Game Boy-enhanced title outside of Japan, a version adding Game Boy Color support was released 
            in Japan seven months later as one of the October 1998 launch titles, featuring colored sprites and backgrounds. This version came out later in 
            Western regions as well. It was also rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console in 2012. A successor to the game was produced and released 
            in 2000, namely Wario Land 3, which adapted most of this game's gameplay mechanics. </p><br>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story begins at Wario Castle. There he lies at his bed, taking a deep nap. However, three shadowy figures approach the castle from outside. They are 
            Pirate Gooms, loyal minions of Captain Syrup and members of the Black Sugar Gang. The pirates infiltrate the building and steal Wario's treasures, which 
            he collected during his earlier adventures. To distract Wario and prevent him from chasing them, the pirates cause havoc in the castle by turning on a 
            giant faucet, abandoning a vicious snake in his cellar and installing an oversized alarm clock. After this, the pirates escape and leave Wario in the mess
            they caused. Wario eventually wakes up by the alarm clocks's commotion and sets off to pursue the thieves, but not before rectifying the state of things in his home.<br>
            During his pursuit of the pirates, Wario learns that the fleeing bandits have scared his pet hen away, so he ditches his quest for a brief moment to rescue 
            his beloved pet. He resumes the pursuit after the hen is safe again. Wario manages to get to the pirate's ship before they can set off. He drops the anchor, 
            so the ship is forced to halt, but is then stopped by the ship guard Bobo, who delays his progress so the pirates can escape via a hot-air balloon. Wario 
            chases them through the overgrown jungle of Maze Woods and a city with an unknown name.<br>
            Wario eventually arrives at Syrup Castle, the hideout of the mischievous pirate gang. Horrified that the pirates managed to return to their fortress, he 
            continues his pursuit and breaks in the building. After battling many of the pirate grunts and four ducks, Wario confronts the pirate leader herself in combat. 
            After defeating Captain Syrup and demolishing her aircraft, Wario blasts the pirates out of their fortress, reclaims his treasures and returns home to resume his nap.<br>
            The game also features alternate pathways and alternate endings, but they generally end with Wario safely back at his castle and his treasures returned. Eventually 
            in the true final chapter (which contains a Time Attack feature), Wario returns to Syrup Castle and proceeds to a mountain range somewhere near the building. There 
            he discovers a secret cave in which the pirates store their treasures. In a final raid, Wario overcomes the difficulties in the pirate cave and plunders Syrup's 
            riches. He then returns home for the final time, but not without the giant spear man following him closely. The pirate's motivation of doing so is unclear.</p><br>
        
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        <p>Wario's primary abilities remain the same as in the previous game. The player can walk, crouch, and enter doors with the +Control Pad, jump using the A Button Button 
            and perform Wario's signature Dash Attack by pressing the B Button Button. If the +Control Pad is pressed up while jumping, Wario will jump slightly higher. The Player 
            can use this technique while jumping on an enemy to jump even higher. When standing on a slope, pressing down will cause Wario to perform a rolling attack, that can 
            smash blocks and defeat enemies. Unlike earlier, Wario can now use a Ground Pound to create shockwaves even without using a Viking helmet. This can be used to reverse 
            enemies' movement, as well as to defeat them. When Wario stuns an enemy by jumping on it, he can pick up the motionless foe and carry it around. Wario's speed will 
            decrease while he is carrying a heavy foe (e.g. a Grunt, or a D.D.).

            A carried foe can be used to defeat other foes by throwing it on them. The player can now also power up Wario's throw by pressing and holding the B Button Button. 
            This will increase Wario's throwing distance and also instantly defeats the tossed enemy if it hits an obstacle.</p><br>
        

        <blockquote><em>“Wario Land 2 is much better than any of my previous games. Why, you ask? Because in this game, I'm immortal! There's no Game Over! With multiple endings, 
            you can play my game MANY times. Isn't that great?!”</em>—Wario, Wario Land II</blockquote>
